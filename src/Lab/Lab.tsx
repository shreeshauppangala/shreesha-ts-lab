              AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS
            </h2>
            <p>
              We are GrayMatter Technologies Prv. Ltd., doing business as Upaz (<strong>&#39;Company&#39;</strong>, <strong>&#39;we&#39;</strong>,<strong>&#39;us&#39;</strong>, or
              <strong>&#39;our&#39;</strong>), a company registered in India at Ground Floor Flat no. 11 and 11A, Golf Apartment,
              Goldf Link, Sujan Singh Marg, Delhi, Delhi 110003.
            </p>
            <p>
              We operate the website <a href='https://portal.upaz.tech'>https://portal.upaz.tech/</a> (the <strong>&#39;Site&#39;</strong>), the mobile application Upaz FO
              App (the <strong>&#39;App&#39;</strong>), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these
              legal terms (the <strong>&#39;Legal Terms&#39;</strong>) (collectively, the <strong>&#39;Services&#39;</strong>).
            </p>
            <p>
              We operate on an innovative panchayat level “Community commerce &amp; Financing Model”
              through our field officers on the ground who onboard 200-400 farmers by forming farmer groups
              of 8-16, each led by a group leader. Enrolled farmers receive the best quality agricultural inputs
              on credit. They pay back the amount in instalments throughout the season. Once agri-inputs are
              delivered, our field officers through our tech stack impart training on research-backed agri-
              practices. Expert advice at each stage helps farmers increase their productivity and direct touch
              with farmers through our field officers helps us in developing a long-lasting relationship with
              farmers. We have 85%+ repeat clients. We are currently working to close the whole loop by
              enabling our farmer network to sell their produce directly to Agri produce buying companies
              through us.
